Programs developed in Python
Random Password is a program developed in python with the help of the random and string libraries.

RANDOMPASSWORD
The program uses a Password_Generator function that is responsible for generating a password of a length given by the user, 
taking random characters from a dictionary that classifies them. In addition, 
a function was implemented that allows me to make sure that the minimum generated passwords have one character of each type 
and that when the password is returned it is reorganized again to make it even more random.
